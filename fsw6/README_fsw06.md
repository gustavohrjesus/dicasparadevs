Create a new branch from the main branch using the command "git branch -c <specificBranch> <newBranch>" and, after that, do checkout to the new branch.
Then, it is necessary to do the commit (git commit -m "feat: description from the new feature") and push the changes (git push -u origin <newBranch>).
